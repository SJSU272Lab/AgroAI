#Project name : AgroAI#

Problem: Every year crop yield suffers due to lack of knowledge on the soil being used and same old practices followed by farmers due which farmers may end up paying more for certain utilities such as irrigation, fertilizers. Farmers also do not have or know the effects of various factors such rainfall on crop yield and soil health.



Solution: We use data analytics and machine learning models for determining soil health. 
We intend to use data from various soil surveys and then develop Machine Learning models which will answer different questions from farmers. 
We intend to provide recommendations aiding the farmer to make well-informed decisions. 
A database is maintained which has cumulative data from different surveys on which machine learning algorithms are executed. 
The system currently provides recommendations for the following -
Irrigation needs of the farmer.
Best suited crops for a particular area [Irrigated/Non-Irrigated Area]
Which crops to plant to prevent soil erosion happening due to strong winds.

Main focus would be generating accurate models and providing useful recommendations.
