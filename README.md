# Fall16-Team20


#Project name : AgroAI#

Problem: Every year crop yield suffers due to lack of knowledge on the soil being used and same old practices followed by farmers due which farmers may end up paying more for certain utilities such as irrigation, fertilizers. Farmers also do not have or know the effects of various factors such rainfall on crop yield and soil health.



Solution: We will use data analytics and machine learning models for determining soil health data. We intend to use data from various soil surveys and then develop Machine Learning models which will answer different questions from farmers answers to which would provide some recommendations aiding the farmer to make well-informed decisions. A database is maintained which has cumulative data from different surveys on which machine learning algorithms are executed. The output/models generated from the algorithms on the cumulative data is sorted and stored in the database. The user sends a query form the system UI for example - sends data rainfall amount and based on this the user requires the rainfall effect on the soil salinity in his farm. The recommendation is based on the generated machine learning models. 

Main focus would be generating accurate models and providing useful recommendations.
